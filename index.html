								<!-- <p>Here, I have documented my last several years of travel, growth, and adventure. These days you'll probably find me on stage performing stand-up, coding, or traveling. This is another chapter in a series of many lives lived; each more thrilling than the last. From Realtor to farm hand to "ski bum" to ice contractor, no change is too strange! I believe in never giving into that tingling fear. It's about leaps of faith! And always ALWAYS "learning my doing." I've learned and grown more from these first-hand experiences than I could have ever expected. I love learning, changing, and problem solving. And I am thrilled to have found a career where I can grow with the industry and continue to change. This chapter? A long and rewarding career in software development.</p> -->

								</h2>
								<p>This year I completed <a href="https://actualize.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Actualize Coding Bootcamp</strong></a>, a Chicago-based software engineering program. I was drawn to the program for its focus on education. I love learning, changing, and problem solving. I am thrilled to have found an industry where growth and change are not just a promise, but a guarantee. So, here's to Actualizing: Cheers to change. Cheers to Development.

								<h2>2020: Welcome to Antarctica<br />
								</h2>
								<p>In 2020, I headed to McMurdo Station, Antarctica for five months to live and work among its pandemic-adjusted-population of 340. Representing the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) at the southernmost tip of Ross Island, McMurdo Station serves as a vital support hub for South Pole Station as well as being a scientific station like no other. Research is conducted on glacial studies to wildlife to astronomy). Many have called McMurdo a "mining town on the moon" and it is truly a place like no other. Here I am pictured in my Extreme Cold Weather "ECW" gear.</p>

								<h2>2019-2020: The Mountains<br />
								</h2>
								<p><u><b><i>Ski Bum:</i></b></u> Once I snagged a job at Loveland Ski Area, I moved across the country to Georgetown, CO in the span of two weeks. (Look how well I adapt! I'd fit in with your team - no problem.) I spent my days working in the ticket office, skiing, snowboarding, and embracing a whole new way of life. I met incredible people and fell in love with the mountain. Pictured here are my friends and I (second from right) on some snowboards.</p>

								<h2>2019: The Farm <br />
								</h2>
								<p><u><b><i>AmeriCorps:</i></b></u> For five months in 2019, I lived and worked on an urban farm in Columbus, Ohio called Franklinton Farms. Ten different plots of residential land and greenhouses formed formed a series of inner-city gardens which made up our larger organization. We put a daily focus on underpriviledged community growth and development. We planted, grew, harvested, and participated in the city's weekly farmers market. (What a thriving metropolis! Our currency? Community. Our trade? Barter.) I will be forever grateful for all the hard lessons learned, the literal labor of love, and being a part of something so special. Pictured is a few of our team and myself (far left) covered in dirt and carrying a large harvest of black raspberries.</p>

								<h2>2017-2019: The City<br />
								</h2>
								<p><u><b><i>Real Estate:</i></b></u> What can I even say about this strange time in my life, except that I could not get enough? I had just earned my B.A. in Psychology and then became deeply interested in the business of people. I worked as a Realtor, attended real estate conferences, and participated in numerous investment groups. Talk about learning by doing! This was a real challenge, and not without pressure; there's always big money on the line. Still, I enjoyed the grind and the challenge - crafting deals from nothing and using my psych degree to negotiate like crazy. Pictured here is the first house I sold. Check out my name on the bottom!</p>

							<li><u><b>Stand-Up Comedy:</b></u>   This past winter I was able to achieve my life-long dream of performing live stand-up comedy. I spent several months writing a set that I would eventually perform in December at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. I love making people laugh, and tend to use humor to lift up my coworkers. [pic?]</li>

							<p></p>

							<li><u><b>Travel:</b></u>  Without a doubt my favorite place is New Zealand. The first time I went, I spent five weeks studying "sustainable tourism" throughout the southern island. We asked ourselves: "Is tourism sustainable?" The answer? "No." [pic?] </li>

							<p></p>
							
							<li><u><b>Healthy Living:</b></u> I.e. putting frozen blueberries in a giant bowl and eating them like the giant tantalizing Dippin' Dots that they are.  [pic?] </li>
						
							<p></p>
							
							<li><u><b>Overkill:</b></u> I also love to rollerskate, play video games, and go to the renaissance festival every chance I get.</li>
