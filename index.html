					<h2>The Coast<br />
					</h2>
					<p>
						The second half of 2022? Making my way up and down California, mulling over the intersection between skill and strength. Restless. Eventually, I realized that I've got tech skills, but I've got humanity strengths. Strengths have been called "values in action," they are about true character. My passions for people, communication, and community reaffirmed, I'll now take everything that I am to contribute meaningfully in this world. My extensive 10+ years in copywriting, my chrontic adaptation, my Psychology degree specializing in attitudes and persuation. A lifetime of writing surreal short stories, poems, and now even stand-up comedy. I'm looking forward to rejoining the tech scene as a writer; a bridge between people and the code that drives us. Currently, I scratch that writing itch as a freelance copywriter and content-creator for a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rachlpolack/" target="_blank"

					<p>
						I spent the first half of 2022 in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) working as a Full-Stack Developer apprentice; a deep-dive into the electric life of a booming tech company. <a href="https://sparkbox.com/" target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sparkbox</strong></a>, a web development consultancy, specializes in ‘household-name’ type clients. I got to witness projects in international retail and big tech evolve first-hand, sitting in on client meetings and adapting to life among the tech-company ecosystem.

					<h2>The Lake<br />
					</h2>
					<p>
						In 2021, I moved into a small shed on Lake Erie in order to change careers. It's beautiful enough to make
						you marvel, but isolated and without distraction. After completing <a href="https://actualize.co"
							target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Actualize Coding Bootcamp</strong></a>, a 4-month Chicago-based software development program, I was hired as a <a
							href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6864577771406950400/" target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>teaching assistant</strong></a> for the following cohort. I was originally drawn to the program for its focus on education, and
						the next 3 months of TA work was likewise very fulfilling.

					<p>
						In 2020 (through 2021), I headed to McMurdo Station, Antarctica for five months to live and work among its
						pandemic-adjusted-population of 340. Representing the <a href="https://www.usap.gov/" target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>United States Antarctic Program (USAP)</strong></a> at the southernmost
						tip of Ross Island, McMurdo Station serves as a vital support hub for South Pole Station and scientific

					<p>From 2019-2020, I moved to western Colorado and embraced a whole new way of life. After getting a job at
						Loveland Ski Area, I moved across the country to Georgetown, CO in the span of two weeks. I spent my days
						working in the ticket office, skiing, snowboarding, and slinging pizzas on the weekends. I met incredible
						people and fell in love with the mountain. <i>Pictured- snowboarding at Loveland with friends (second from

						Franklinton Farms is a series of gardens and

					<h2>The City<br />

					<p><u><b><i></i></b></u> From 2017 to 2019, I became deeply involved in the business of people. In addition to
						my work as a Realtor, I spent my
						weekends attending real estate conferences and participating in investment groups. These ventures were
						unique, and not
						without pressure. Even so, I loved the grind and the challenge - crafting deals from nothing and putting my

						<li class="icon fa-flag">
							<h3 class="flag-space">RRR App Live Demo</h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>
								<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/SFxVsFiVKoA?start=264&ecver=1 "

							<p>Run Rabbit Run (RRR) App, my <strong>Bootcamp Capstone Project.</strong> Major life pursuits demand
								major pacing. Such as alternating chapters of respite/planning with adventure.
								This app is all
								about that planning, earnestly, with a dry humor that scoffs at the notion of taking life too seriously.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>[RRR continued] Run Rabbit Run is a full-stack digital bucket list built with `Vue.js` and `Ruby on
								Rails`. Take your wildest
								dreams and
								break them down into small, actionable steps. Add, categorize, sort, and pursue anything you want to do
								before you "kick
								the bucket." Then, push your achievements to your "bucket," making it so full that you can't, and won't
								want to, kick it
								over. The bucket is full and so are you.</p>
						</li>

						<li class="icon fa-flag">
							<h3 class="flag-space">Apprenticeship Capstone</h3>
							<p>The Team Availability App will be implemented for future use at Sparkbox upon completion. It'll be used
								to gauge how available
								different team members are in any given week. To be used primarily by project managers, this tool also
								includes details about each developer or designer. PMs can get info on skills, interests, and past
								projects in order to inform planning decisions. This app is still in progress, but the <a
									href="https://fellowship-availability.netlify.app/" target="_blank"
									rel="noopener  noreferrer"><strong>current deployment</strong></a> is availabile along with a <a
									href="	https://github.dev/sparkbox/team-availability" target="_blank"
									rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>in-browser editor</strong></a> on gitHub. This is a group project
								and is spearheaded by the three apprentices, utilizing agile web development through Jira every step of
								the way. Among the many tools used are `Next.js` and `SCSS`.</p>
						</li>

						<li class="icon fa-flag">
							<h3 class="flag-space">Sparkjoke</h3>
							<p>A <a href="https://github.com/howema/apprenticeship-sparkjoke" target="_blank"
									rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>random joke generator API</strong></a> app built in vanilla
								Javascript by a team of three. As always, accessibility is a top focus along with agile development
								fuelled by daily Standups. I'm planning on deploying this shortly.</p>
						</li>

						<li class="icon fa-flag">
							<h3 class="flag-space">Gilded Rose</h3>
							<p>Does it get any more classic <a href="https://github.dev/howema/apprenticeship-gilded-rose"
									target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><i>classic</i></strong></a> than this? A hearty dive
								into <strong>Functional Programming</strong>.</p>
						</li>

						<li class="icon fa-flag">
							<h3 class="flag-space">Frontend | CSS</h3>
							<p>Checkout my completed CSS adventure website, lovingly titled <a
									href="https://mhowe.dev/html-css-rainforest-safari/" target="_blank"
									rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rainforest Safari</strong></a>. This deployment is a complete
								documentation of teaching myself CSS from the ground up, completing a 20-part detailed program.</p>

							<p>Among my <a href="https://codepen.io/howema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Codepen
										Projects</strong></a> is extensive iterations of an event card which focuses on accessible,
								mobile-first development, and an emphasis on semantic use of HTML. The card changes each time, but
								ultimately culmenates in use of SCSS, animations, svgs, Grid, and more. In my more recent Codepen
								exercises, I'm sure to use ITCSS for best practices.</p>
