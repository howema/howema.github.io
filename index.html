								<h2>Seasonal Worker turned Software Developer<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Here, I have documented my last several years of travel, growth, and adventure. These days you'll probably find me on stage performing stand-up, coding, or traveling. Still though, this is another chapter, in a series of many lives lived; each more exhilarating than the last. From Realtor to farm hand to "ski bum" to ice contractor, no change is too strange! I believe in never giving into that tingling fear. So what of failing or looking foolish? It's about leaps of faith! And always ALWAYS about "learning my doing." The next chapter? A long and rewarding career in software development.</p>

								<h2>2020: Welcome to Antarctica<br />
								</h2>
								<p>In 2020, I headed to McMurdo Station, Antarctica to live and work among its adjusted pandemic-population of 340. For five months, I lived and worked as a Support Contractor representing the United States Antarctic Program (or USAP, as they like to say). McMurdo is one of three US research stations, and resides at the southernmost part of Ross Island, Antarctica. It serves as a vital support hub for South Pole Station as well as research a variety of areas from glacial studies to wildlife to astronomy. (We even had penguin counters!) Many have called McMurdo a "mining town on the moon" and it is truly a place like no other. I am pictured here in my Extreme Cold Weather "ECW" gear. ---link to library pic as well?</p>

								<h2>2019-2020: Ski Bum<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Once I snagged a job at Loveland Ski Area, I moved across the country to Georgetown, CO in the span of two weeks. (Look how well I adapt! I'd fit in with your team no problem.) I spent my days working in the ticket office, skiing, snowboarding, and embracing a whole new way of life. I met incredible people and fell in love with the mountain. Loveland unfortunately closed for the season in March once COVID hit, but we were lucky enough to be tucked away in the mountains and surrounded ample outdoor opportunity to pass the time. Pictured here are my friends and I (second from right) on some snowboards.</p>

								<h2>2019: Farm Hand<br />
								</h2>
								<p>For five months in 2019, I lived and worked on an urban farm in Columbus, Ohio called Franklinton Farms. The first three were through AmeriCorps with the last few centering on running our farmer's market. Our urban farm (ten different plots of residential land in the heart of the city) formed a series of gardens and greenhouses that made up our larger organization. We put a daily focus on community growth and development with the aim of stamping out food deserts due to poverty. We planted, grew, and harvested a wide variety of produce. One thing I'll never forget -- there's nothing like scorching hot tomato tunnel (like a greenhouse) in july. I will be forever grateful to be a part of such a community, the hard lessons learned, and the literal labor of love. Pictured here is a few of our team and myself (far left) covered in dirt and picking a large harvest of black raspberries.</p>

								<h2>2017-2019: Realtor & Investor<br />
								</h2>
								<p>What can I even say about this strange time in my life, except that I could not get enough? I had just earned my B.A. in Psychology and then became deaply interested in the business of people and investment. During this time, I worked as a Realtor, studied real estate relentlessly, participated in numerous investment groups, and attended real estate conferences. I sold several houses and was on my way to a promising career. But one day you wake up and realize there's more out there. And I'm not afraid of change, to say the least. Once I realize I've made a mistake, I immediatly stop making it. Pictured here is the first house I sold. Check out my name on the bottom!</p>
