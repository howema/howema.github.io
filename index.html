								<h2>Seasonal Worker turned Software Developer<br />

								<p>Here, I have documented my last several years of travel, growth, and adventure. It's been a series of vastly different experiential chapters; each more rewarding than the last. I am so grateful for these opportunities and for the many lives lived. After completing <a href="https://actualize.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Actualize Coding Bootcamp</strong></a>, I am thrilled to join an industry that is the very definition of growth and opportunity.</p>

								<h2>2021: Development

								</h2>
								<p>This year I completed <a href="https://actualize.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Actualize Coding Bootcamp</strong></a>, a Chicago-based software engineering program. I was drawn to the program for its focus on education. I love learning, changing, and problem solving. I am thrilled to have found an industry where growth and change are not just a promise, but a guarantee. So, here's to Actualizing: Cheers to change. Cheers to Development.

								<h2>The Ice<br />
								</h2>
								<p>In 2020 (through 2021), I headed to McMurdo Station, Antarctica for five months to live and work among its pandemic-adjusted-population of 340. Representing the <a href="https://www.usap.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>United States Antarctic Program (USAP)</strong></a> at the southernmost tip of Ross Island, McMurdo Station serves as a vital support hub for South Pole Station and scientific research. Many have called McMurdo a "mining town on the moon" and it is truly a place like no other. <i>Pictured- sunset on the ice in my Extreme Cold Weather "ECW" gear.</i></p>

								<h2>The Mountains<br />
								</h2>
								<p><u><b><i></i></b></u> From 2019-2020, I moved to western Colorado and embraced a whole new way of life. After getting a job at Loveland Ski Area, I moved across the country to Georgetown, CO in the span of two weeks. I spent my days working in the ticket office, skiing, snowboarding, and slinging pizzas on the weekends. I met incredible people and fell in love with the mountain. I learned a lot about culture, values, and different ways to live. <i>Pictured- snowboarding at Loveland with friends (second from right).</i></p>

								<p><u><b><i></i></b></u> In 2019, I served in <a href="https://americorps.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>AmeriCorps</strong></a> on an urban farm in Columbus, Ohio. Franklinton Farms is a series of gardens and greenhouses on ten different plots of residential land in the heart of the city. We put a daily focus on underpriviledged community access to healthy whole foods. I liked the farming, but I loved our family. I will be forever grateful for the many hard lessons learned and the literal labor of love. <i>Pictured- our team with a large harvest of black raspberries.</i></p>

								<h2>The City<br />
								</h2>
								<p><u><b><i></i></b></u> From 2017 to 2019, I became deeply involved in the business of people. In addition to my work as a Realtor, I spent my weekends attending real estate conferences and participating in investment groups. These ventures were unique, and not without pressure. Even so, I loved the grind and the challenge - crafting deals from nothing and putting my Psych degree to work negotiating like crazy. <i>Pictured- the first house I ever sold.</i></p>

										<h3>Run Rabbit Run</h3>
										<p>I'm excited to share my Capstone Presentation for Actualize Coding Bootcamp! Run Rabbit Run is a full-stack digital bucket list app that I build using Vue.js on the frontend and Ruby on Rails in the back. Take your wildest dreams and break them down into small, actionable steps. Categorize, sort, and pursue everything you want to do before you "kick the bucket." Then, push your achievements to your "bucket" such that it's so full you can't, and won't want to, kick it over.  </p>
	
											<p>This app was inspired by my many adventures and travel and passion for seasonal work. I've lived in a hut in Maine, on an urban farm, at a ski resort, and also for 5 months in Antarctica. My life thus far has been defined as alternating between chapters of respite and planning - and adventure. This app is all about the planning, earnestly, even if it takes a sort fun tongue-in-cheek approach. </p>
											
											<p> I had a ton of fun putting it together, and have loved beginning this new chapter of growth in an industry defined by change and opportunity.</p>

									<h3>Run Rabbit Run</h3>
									<p>This is my Capstone Project to conclude my time at Actualize and put my new skills to work. I had a lot of fun with this project that I am affectionately calling a "Pinterest for Bucket List." Users can add, edit, search for, delete, and highlight bucket list "experiences" that they wish to accomplish before they kick the bucket. </p>

										<p>One prominent feature involves adding "tags" to each experience item, like adding the "Especially Weird" tag to your lifelong goal of "Living on a Nudist Colony." Don't be intimidated, though! Some of your goals can be achieved today! Search by "Nothing to It" and the app will help you recall that "Donating blood" is a very achievable goal that you can achieve today.</p>
										
										<p> addition, the app includes a To Do list feature that breaks each of your experience goals into actionable steps. Run Rabbit Run! Go get 'em. The app also includes funny quips, easter eggs, and plenty of tongue-in-cheek homor.</p>

									<h3>Best Aquarium Buy</h3>
								
									<p>This is my mini-capstone project that I built before I began my final capstone project "Run Rabbit Run." It is essentially a mock Amazon app that displays products and allows users to add them to their cart, but with a fun twist of all products being aquarium related. Products can be added, edited and removed. They each also include pricing and vendor information. I kept this app lighthearted and fun by adding plenty of my subtle tongue-in-cheek humor as well as pre-built in mythological creatures that you can buy. Not only can you buy a leviathan, but also a shark ("buy 1 get one free"), and bubbles ("just in case"). </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Monster Movie</h3>
									<p>This app highlights the many possibilities involved with associations. Actors have many movies, and movies have many actors! This app not only allows users to log and edit their favorite movies, but also allows searching by genre, director, and associated actors. I paid special attention to the frontend to make this user friendly and to also invoke heavy old-timey cinema themes for a cozy feel.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Blog App</h3>
									<p>This is a full stack app that allows users to create, edit, view, and delete a range of blog posts in an easy manner combined a fashionable design. An API is utilized and the interface is minimal, pleasing, and modern.</p>
